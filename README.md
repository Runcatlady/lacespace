Shoe mileage tracker for runners.
This is an app that tracks your running shoes mileage effortlessly. It is designed to help runners of all levels monitor the distance logged on each pair of running shoes to ensure optimal performance and injury prevention. Whether you're training for a marathon or enjoying casual jogs, this user-friendly interface makes it easy to input multiple shoes and their mileage and also alerts the user when a shoe has reached 450+ miles and whether or not to remove that shoe from the rotation. It is a simple, and easy way to stay ahead of wear and tear. 

There is a textarea that fills up with the information you put into the text fields for step 1 and step 2 and click the button - save shoes. 
There is a timestamp after the last entry made. 
You can clear the entire textarea by clicking the button - clear all shoes.
Once a shoe has reached 450 miles, you will be alerted what the actual mileage is and whether or not you would like to remove them from the list 
if you choose cancel, it will keep the shoes and keep alerting you of their mileage and whether or not you would like to remove them. 
Enjoy! I hope you like it's simplicity.
